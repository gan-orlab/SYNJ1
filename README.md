# SYNJ1

In this project we studied role of rare SYNJ1 variants in Parkinson's disease

##Role of rare SYNJ1 variants##

#Cohorts sequenced at McGill#
For cohorts sequenced at McGill SYNJ1 gene was captured using molecular inversion probs. Full protocol is available at https://github.com/gan-orlab/MIP_protocol.
We performed standart filtering procedures using MIPVar pipeline (https://github.com/gan-orlab/MIPVar).

#We also used AMP-PD and UKBB data#
Alignment for these data was performed using the human reference genome (hg38)
For AMP-PD we utilized Terra platform

#Analysis of UKBB cohort was performed localy using Neurohub#
Filtration detailed in the UKBB script provided for ARSA gene on our github.

#Analysis of AMP-PD data was performed using Terra platform#

#burden analysis and meta-analysis between cohort was performed using SKAT-0 and meta-SKAT packages#
detailed in the meta-analysis script
